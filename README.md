# Enterprise-chat-and-file-transfer

This app is done as an experiment for peer to peer chatting and file transfer using java sockets and rmi.
The app enable clients to send and receive messages from other servers while also being servers themselves at other times.
One client leaving doesn't affect the availability of others.
We don't use any external user interface for the system and use regular gui programming
